# SciGuides

Welcome to SciGuides, a repository made by FRC Team 1155 and 2265 to gather all of our experience and knowledge for public and internal use.

## Usage

SciGuides is project-based, containing guides and reference sheets aimed at guiding readers towards a high level of competency around FRC code.

It can be used as teaching material, robot code practice, or for referencing information and generational knowledge.

This repository additionally functions as the curriculum of our school's central robotics program.

## Contributing & Updating

There are a few values we emphasize when writing SciGuides:

- Don't reinvent the wheel.
  - Maintaining more than necessary, or redundant information, would be a waste of time, so we heavily reference existing documentation from vendors, libraries, and WPILib.
  - Minimize what must be changed from year-to-year! There is no need to restate information with existing documentation past a simple sentence or past the purposes of introduction.

- Be concise.
  - It's harder and daunting to read gigantic walls of text.

- Experiencing is the heart of learning.
  - It is our firm belief that people learn best when actually **writing** and **seeing** code (not just text) on the screen. Code examples, code examples, code examples (and the occasional image and gif, too!)

- These guidelines are not immutable.
  - Use your own discretion (or that of your fellow team members) to determine what is best for this repository to achieve its goals.
