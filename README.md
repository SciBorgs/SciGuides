## Best Practices

As you go through these tutorials and projects, here are some practices you should try to follow:
1. Go through all example code thoroughly until you understand it. If it's not clicking, ask for help.
3. If there's ever a concept that you don't understand, ask for help!
4. Do the work **on your own**. You can talk to your friends about concepts, but for the most part, go at your own pace, and try to understand the concepts on your own before asking for help.
	1. Some projects are explicitly made to work as group projects. In those situations, you can of course work with a group, but still make sure that you're writing your section on your own!
5. When you ask for help, you have a few options:
	1. Maybe there's someone you're working with who you can ask, and if they know the answer, that's great. 
	2. Ideally, you also have someone who's a more experienced programmer who can help you when you need it. 
	3. If you find yourself without anyone who can help you, here are a couple options:
		1. Look it up
		2. Ask Claude (or ChatGPT if you prefer). Be careful not to use a prompt that will cause it to give too much away --- if it tells you all the answers, it will be harder to learn. And I can't guarantee that it will always give you great answers. But it's a good resource to have when you don't have anything else.
