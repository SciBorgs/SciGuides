# SciGuides

Welcome to SciGuides, a repository made by FRC Team 1155 to gather all of our experience and knowledge for public and internal use. We thank 2265, our sister team, for their contributions.

## Usage

SciGuides is project-based, containing [tutorial projects](/projects/README.md) and [reference sheets](/reference-sheets/README.md) aimed at guiding readers towards a high level of competency around FRC code.

It can be used to teach material, practice writing robot code, reference information, or pass down generational knowledge[^1]. It may be highly opinionated and team-personalized as a result.

[^1]: As we do not have programming mentors, this repository serves as the only way to pass down and retrieve generational knowledge. In the event of another lockdown, this repository will be vital in restoring team skills.

This repository also functions as the curriculum of our school's JV robotics program.  

If you spot any mistakes, please let official team programmers know! Feel free to create a GitHub issue or notify a mentor.

## Contributing & Updating

SciGuides is a ***living document***. It should be updated yearly to reflect the latest changes in WPILib, vendor APIs, team practices, and more.

See [Contributing.md](Contributing.md) for specific directions on what we're looking for.
