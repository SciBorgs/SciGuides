# SciGuides

Welcome to SciGuides, a repository made by FRC Team 1155 to gather all of our experience and knowledge for public and internal use. We thank 2265, our sister team, for their contributions.

## Usage

SciGuides is project-based, containing [tutorial projects](/projects/README.md) and [reference sheets](/reference-sheets/README.md) aimed at guiding readers towards a high level of competency around FRC code.

It can be used to teach material, practice writing robot code, reference information, or pass down generational knowledge[^1].

[^1]: As we do not have programming mentors, this repository serves as the only way to pass down and retrieve generational knowledge. In the event of another lockdown, this repository will be vital in restoring team skills.

This repository functions as the curriculum of our school's JV robotics program.  

## Contributing & Updating

SciGuides is a ***living document***. It should be updated yearly to reflect the latest changes in WPILib, vendor APIs, team practices, and more.

There are a few values we emphasize when writing SciGuides:

- Don't reinvent the wheel.
  - Maintaining more than necessary, or redundant information, would be a waste of time, so we heavily reference existing documentation from vendors, libraries, and WPILib.
  - Minimize what must be changed from year-to-year! There is no need to restate information with existing documentation past a simple sentence or past the purposes of introduction.

- Experiencing is the heart of learning.
  - It is our firm belief that people learn best when actually **writing** and **seeing** code (not just text) on the screen. Code examples, code examples, code examples (and the occasional image and gif, too!)
  - In the same vein, aim to be as concise and to-the-point as possible. Gigantic text walls are daunting and difficult to follow.

- Keep to typical standards of documentation.
  - Please look over your grammar, punctuation, and spelling before submitting your PR for review. At worst, errors should not obstruct understanding.

- These guidelines are not immutable.
  - Use your own discretion (or that of your fellow team members) to determine what is best for this repository to achieve its goals.
