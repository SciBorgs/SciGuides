# SciGuides

Welcome to SciGuides, a repository made by FRC team 1155 to gather all of our experience and knowledge for public and internal use.

## About

This "manual" contains projects, which guide readers to a high level of competency around FRC robot code. It is intended to be very opinionated, focusing on our team's style and WPILibJ. SciGuides has a project based curriculum, consisting of guides for challenges on a real robot or simulation.

## Goals

Our team lacks formal programming mentorship, which is typically essential in long term success on software teams, as well as preserving generational knowledge. In the creation and maintenance of this guide, we attempt to solve this issue.

We, however, do not intend for this to replicate existing documentation. Maintaining more than necessary, or redundant information, would be a waste of time, so the guides heavily reference [WPILib documentation](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/index.html).

## Updating

Make sure to update or create guides based on future developments.
