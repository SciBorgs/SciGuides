# Robot Simulation

Simulation in WPILib allows for code and logic to be tested onboard your computer, rather than physical hardware. It's exceptionally useful for when construction has not built the robot, but you have code to run!

There are a few different facets of simulation to take note of before you can start, including:

- Logging & Dashboards
- The Simulation GUI
- [WPILIB's simulation classes](#simulation-classes)
  - Physics simulators
  - Mechanism2d
  - Field2d

## Simulation Classes

This section will heavily reference the WPILIB docs [here](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/wpilib-tools/robot-simulation/introduction.html).

Before you start, make sure desktop support is turned on. Follow [these instructions](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/wpilib-tools/robot-simulation/introduction.html).

This [helpful guide](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/wpilib-tools/robot-simulation) shows the different elements of the GUI.
